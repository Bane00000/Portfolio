# Introduction to the project

## Some things to know

* I am working with three csvs. Train and test csvs are for training and testing, and labels is for target value for training csv.

* This is a time-series project, meaning dates are in chronological order.

* For the rest of the work I will only be working with 'train' and merge it with 'labels' csv until the very end, where I will use test csv to predict the disease

* There are two cities, San Juan, and Iquitos. Sj, and iq for short.

* For sj in the training data, dates range from 1990 to 2008, while test data continues from 2008. Same with iq, except date ranges from 2000 to 2010.
